**Project Title: Handwritten Digits Classification using PyTorch**

*Objective*:\
Classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using a deep learning model with a softmax activation function, and monitor training progress through accuracy and loss plots.

*Key Responsibilities:*

1.Designed and implemented a neural network model using PyTorch.\
2.Applied softmax activation function in the output layer for multi-class classification.\
3.Trained the model on the MNIST dataset, handling data preprocessing and augmentation.\
4.Evaluated model performance based on accuracy and total loss metrics.\
5.Plotted epoch vs. accuracy and total loss to visualize and optimize the training process.\

*Skills and Tools:*

1.PyTorch for model development and training.\
2.Softmax activation function for multi-class classification.\
3.Matplotlib for plotting and visualizing training metrics.\
4.Experience with neural network design, data preprocessing, and model evaluation.\

*Results:*
Achieved 98% accuracy on the MNIST test dataset.
Effectively visualized training progress through plots of epoch vs. accuracy and total loss.
